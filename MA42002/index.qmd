## Lecture notes
You can find lecture notes for the module on this page. If you would like a pdf this can be easily generated by clicking on the pdf link on the top left of the webpages. I will occasionally edit/update the notes as we proceed through lectures. If you spot any errors/typos/inconsistencies/omissions etc. please let me know.

## Python codes

I have provided Python codes for most of the figures in the notes (you can unfold code section by clicking `Code'). Note that the Python code does not appear in the pdf.

 Many of you have taken the Introduction to Programming module at Level 2 and have therefore some experience using Python. I strongly encourage you to use the provided codes as a tool to play around with numerical solutions of the various models that we will be working on. The codes should run as standalone Python codes.
