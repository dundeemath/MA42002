**Dictyostelium discoideum** is a slime-mold. It is widely studied experimentally since the individual amoebae that constitute the slime-mold exhibit a range of phenomena also observed in developmental biology by cells e.g. differentiation, proliferation, migration. During one particular stage of its life-cycle the single-cell amoebae become starved of food and begin to secrete a diffusible chemical, cyclic AMP or cAMP. The amoebae respond chemotactically to cAMP and begin to migrate towards regions of high cAMP concentration via  *chemotaxis*. As they migrate they generate a range of intricate patterns including *spiral waves* and *streaming* aggregation patterns. Examples of such patterns can be seen in figure \ref{dicty1}.

##  Model derivation

We consider a model for the aggregation of *Dictyostelium discoideum* through the secretion of and chemotactic response to cAMP. We denote by $n({\bf x}, t)$ the density of amoebae and $a({\bf x}, t)$ the concentration of cAMP. The general conservation equation for the amoebae can be written:

$$
\frac{\partial n}{\partial  t} + \nabla \cdot {\bf J} = f(n,a),
$$

where $f(n,a)$ models any reaction terms for the amoebae e.g. proliferation, and the flux is given by

$$
{\bf J} = {\bf J}_{diffusion} + {\bf J}_{chemotaxis}
$$

Assuming Fickian diffusion and the general chemotactic flux stated earlier, the general * reaction-diffusion-chemotaxis*model for the amoebae responding to cAMP is given by:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial n}{\partial  t} & = & \underbrace{D_n \nabla^2 n}_{diffusion} - \underbrace{\nabla \cdot \left( \chi(a) n \nabla a \right)}_{chemotaxis} + f(n,a)   \\
\frac{\partial a}{\partial  t} & = &  D_a \nabla^2 a + g(n,a), 
\end{eqnarray*}

where we have assumed Fickian diffusion for the cAMP and $g(a,n)$ represents the kinetics i.e. source/sink terms, of cAMP. 

One simple model has the following assumptiond:

$$f(n,a) = 0, \;\;\; g(n,a) = \mu n - \delta a, \;\;\; \chi (a) = \chi_0$$

i.e. 

* there are no kinetics for the amoebae - they simply move randomly via diffusion and undergo chemotaxis in response to cAMP;

* proliferation is neglected; - this is a reasonable assumption given the timescales involved, since they amoebae move on a faster timescale than they proliferate;

* the amoebae are assumed to produce cAMP in proportion to their density, which means the more amoebae there are, the more cAMP (a reasonable first approximation);

* the chemotactic function is taken to be a constant, again a reasonable first approximation;

* $D_a > D_n$ since chemicals diffuse faster than cells move randomly.

Under such assumption we obtain the model equation

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial n}{\partial  t} & = & D_n \nabla^2 n - \chi_0 \nabla \cdot \left( n \nabla a \right), \\
\frac{\partial a}{\partial  t} & = &  D_a \nabla^2 a +  \mu n - \delta a,
\end{eqnarray*}

which becomes, when considering a 1-dimensional domain $[0,L]$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial n}{\partial  t} & = & D_n \frac{\partial ^2 n}{\partial x^2} - \chi_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( n \frac{\partial a}{\partial x} \right), \\
  & & \hspace{4.5cm} ( \dagger ) \\
\frac{\partial a}{\partial  t} & = &  D_a \frac{\partial ^2 a}{\partial x^2}  +  \mu n - \delta a,
\end{eqnarray*}

with zero flux boundary conditions:

\begin{eqnarray*}
D_a \frac{\partial a}{\partial  x} & = & 0, \;\;\; x = 0,L, \\
D_n \frac{\partial n}{\partial  x} - \chi_0 n \frac{\partial a}{\partial  x} & = & 0, \;\;\; x = 0,L,
\end{eqnarray*}

which in this case reduce to:

$$
\frac{\partial a}{\partial  x} = \frac{\partial n}{\partial  x} = 0, \;\;\; x = 0,L
$$

## Spatially Homogeneous Steady States

The spatially homogeneous steady state $(n^* , a^* )$ satisfies:

$$\mu n^* = \delta a^*$$

and we now undertake a linear stability analysis to determine whether this is stable or unstable. If the above spatially homogeneous steady state is unstable, this will indicate that aggregation patterns may arise in the system.

## Stability Analysis

In a similar manner to previous stability analyses, we consider small perturbations around the spatially homogeneous steady state $(n^* , a^* )$, i.e.

$$
n(x,t) = n^* + \tilde{n}(x,t), \;\;\; a(x,t) = a^* + \tilde{a}(x,t)
$$

where $\tilde{n}(x,t)$ and $\tilde{a}(x,t)$ are ``small" so that higher order terms can be neglected.

**NOTE** Unlike previous stability analysis, these perturbations are both time and *space* dependent.

Substituting the above perturbations into equations $( \dagger )$, we neglect higher order terms and retain only linear terms. This is largely straightforward, but we provide some detail for the linearization of the chemotactic term i.e. 

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[ ( n^* + \tilde{n}) \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( a^* + \tilde{a} \right) \right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[ ( n^* + \tilde{n}) \frac{\partial \tilde{a}}{\partial x}  \right] \approx n^* \frac{\partial ^2 \tilde{a}}{\partial x^2}$$

The fully linearized system is then given by:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \tilde{n}}{\partial  t} & =  D_n \frac{\partial ^2 \tilde{n}}{\partial x^2} - \chi_0 n^* \frac{\partial ^2 \tilde{a}}{\partial x^2} \\
\frac{\partial \tilde{a}}{\partial  t} & =   D_a \frac{\partial ^2 \tilde{a}}{\partial x^2}  +  \mu \tilde{n} - \delta \tilde{a}.
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}
$$ {#eq-chemotax_linear}

Although the above equations are linear, an explicit solution is non-trivial and we are required to make a further *ansatz*. We use the``separation of variables " approach where 
$$
\tilde{n}(t,x) = u(t) \phi_1(x)
$$ 
and 
$$
\tilde a (t,x) = v(t) \phi_2(x)
$$

\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial u}{\partial  t}  \phi_1  =   D_n  u\frac{\partial ^2 \phi_1}{\partial x^2} - \chi_0 n^*  v\frac{\partial ^2 \phi_1}{\partial x^2} \\
& \frac{v}{\partial  t}  \phi_2=     D_a v \frac{\partial ^2  \phi_2}{\partial x^2}  +  \mu u \,  \phi_1 - \delta v\,  \phi_2, \\
& u \frac{\partial \phi_1}{\partial x} = 0, \quad   v \frac{\partial \phi_2}{\partial x} = 0 \quad \text{ for } \; x = 0, \; x=L.
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray*}

We assume that  
$$
\phi_1 = \phi_2 = \phi,
$$
 where $\phi_1$ is the solution of the elliptic problem 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^2 \phi}{dx^2} &= - k^2 \phi && \text{ in } \; (0,L), \\
\frac{d \phi}{dx} &= 0  && \text{ for } \; x=0, \; x=L. 
\end{aligned}
$$
We can compute that solution of the equation for $\phi$ are of the form 
$$
\phi(x) = A \cos(kx) + B\sin(kx).
$$
  Since $\phi$ satisfied zero Neumann boundary conditions we have that 
$\phi(x) = A \cos(kx)$, with an arbitrary const $A$, and $k = \dfrac {m \pi} L$, \; $m \in \mathbb N$. 

Then we have
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial u}{\partial  t}  \phi  =   - k^2 D_n  u \phi +  \chi_0 n^* k^2\,  v \, \phi,  \\
& \frac{v}{\partial  t} \phi =   - k^2 D_a  \, v \phi  +  \mu u \,  \phi - \delta v\,  \phi, 
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
 and since $\phi$ is not identically zero on $(0,L)$ we obtain a system of linear ODEs for $(u(t),v(t))$
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial u}{\partial  t}    =   - k^2 D_n  u  +  \chi_0 n^* k^2\,  v,  \\
& \frac{v}{\partial  t} =   - k^2 D_a  \, v  +  \mu u  - \delta v. 
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

We know that solutions of linear ODEs have the form 
$$
u(t) = C_1 e^{\lambda t} \quad \textrm{and} \quad v(t) = C_2 e^{\lambda t}
$$
 for some constant $C_1$, $C_2$ and $\lambda$ are eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix. 

Thus  we obtain 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lambda C_1 & = & - D_n k^2 C_1  + \chi_0 n^* k^2 C_2,  \\
\lambda C_2 & = & - D_a k^2 C_2 +  \mu C_1 - \delta C_2,
\end{eqnarray*}

which can be written

$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
- D_n k^2 - \lambda &  \chi_0 n^* k^2 \\
\mu & - D_a k^2 -\delta -\lambda 
\end{array}
\right) 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
C_1 \\
C_2
\end{array}
\right) = \bf{0} .
$$


 **Remark** Notice that we obtained that  $\tilde n$ and $\tilde a$ are of the form 
 $$\tilde{n}(x,t) = C_1 e^{\lambda t} e^{ikx}, \;\;\; \tilde{a}(x,t) = C_2 e^{\lambda t} e^{ikx}.$$ 


For a non-trivial solution (for non-trivial perturbations $\tilde n$, $\tilde a$), i.e. $C_1 \neq 0$ and $C_2 \neq 0$, the determinant of the above matrix must be zero, and this leads to the following quadratic equation to be solved for $\lambda$: 

$$
\lambda^2 + \left( D_n k^2 + D_a k^2 + \delta \right) \lambda + D_n k^2 \left( D_a k^2 + \delta \right) - \mu \chi_0 n^* k^2 = 0.
$$

This is of the form
$$
\lambda^2 + \alpha \lambda + \beta = 0,
$$

and so has roots:
$$
\lambda = \frac{-\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4 \beta}}{2}.$$

**NOTE** This has two *real* roots, since 
$$
\alpha^2 - 4 \beta > 0
$$ (see Exercise/Tutorial).

For stability, we require both roots to be negative. Since both roots are real, this leads to:

$$
\lambda < 0  \Leftrightarrow \alpha > 0 \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \beta >0.
$$

Now 
$$\alpha = D_n k^2 + D_a k^2 + \delta > 0,
$$ 
and so for stability, we require $\beta > 0$ i.e. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
& & D_n k^2 \left( D_a k^2 + \delta \right) - \mu \chi_0 n^* k^2 > 0 \\
& & \Rightarrow \mu \chi_0 n^* <  D_n  \left( D_a k^2 + \delta \right)
\end{eqnarray*}

Hence, we will have instability when this condition is not satisfied i.e. 
$$
\mu \chi_0 n^* >  D_n  \left( D_a k^2 + \delta \right).
$$

The precise value of $k^2$ can be determined from the zero-flux boundary conditions i.e.
$$ 
k  =  \frac{m \pi}{L}, \;\;\; m = 1,2, \dots 
$$
if we look  for non-constant $\phi$.

Hence, we will have instability whenever
$$
\mu \chi_0 n^* >  D_n  \left( D_a \frac{m^2 \pi^2}{L^2} + \delta \right), \;\;\; m = 1,2, \dots
$$

It can be shown (see Exercise/Tutorial), that $\lambda (k^2)$ ( or $\lambda (m^2)$) is monotonic decreasing and hence the fastest growing mode is $m=1$ i.e. we have an instability as long as
$$
\mu \chi_0 n^* >  D_n  \left( \frac{D_a \pi^2}{L^2} + \delta \right).
$$

In general, from the above inequality, we can say that there is a likelihood of instability (amoebae aggregation) if:

* $D_a$, $D_n$ and $\delta$ are all ``small''
* L is ``large''
* $\chi_0 , \mu , n^*$ are ``large''

Considering all other parameters to be fixed, in theory the above result states that it is possible to find a large enough value for the chemotactic coefficient $\chi_0$ to satisfy the instability condition i.e. chemotaxis induces instability and leads to aggregation of the amoebae.

\begin{center}
chemotaxis is a destabilizing effect \\
diffusion is a stabilizing effect cf. fundamental solution to the diffusion equation
\end{center}

However, there is one type of system where diffusion also has a destabilizing effect...
