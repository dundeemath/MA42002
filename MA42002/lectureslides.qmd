## Lecture 1 

* Introduction to MA42002
* Conservation equations
* Examples of spatially homogeneous models



## Conservation equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
\text{rate of change}\\
\text{ in the population density} 
\end{pmatrix}
&= \begin{pmatrix}
\text{spatial movement}
\end{pmatrix}
\\
 &+\begin{pmatrix}
 \text{birth, growth, death},\\
 \text{production or degradation}\\
  \text{due to chemical reactions} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}

#  Spatially homogeneous models (MA32009 revision)

## Example problem - bacteria in a dish
$$\begin{aligned}
N(t+\Delta t) &=  \quad N(t)   + \quad  K N(t) \Delta t.
\end{aligned} 
$$

## A model for cell growth under nutrient depletion

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dN}{dt} &= K(c) N = \kappa cN,  \\
 \frac{ dc}{dt} &= - \alpha \frac{dN}{dt} = - \alpha   \kappa c N,  
 \end{aligned}
$${#eq-c_1}

## Leading to the logistic growth equation
The last equation can be rewritten as
$$  
\frac{dN}{dt} = \rho  N \,  (1 - \frac N B)  \qquad \quad N(0)= N_0, 
$$ {#eq-n_5}

## Can also consider other biological processes




## Exercise

Consider a well mixed bio reactor. 

A biologist cultures an initial cell population of size $N_0$ in the bioreactor for 72 h.

Cells undergo division with a period of 14 h.

Each cell produces a non-degradable waste product, $W$, at rate $k_1$.

When total waste levels exceed a threshold, $W^*$, cell division stops. Otherwise the cell population grows exponentially.

How many cells are there at the end of the experiment?


## Model development

2. Schematic diagram - what processes are being modelled?
3. Governing equations?
4. Define model parameters?
5. Initial conditions?

# Lecture 2

##  The SIR model

Consider the SIR model equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d S}{ dt} &= -rIS, \\
\frac{d I}{ dt} &= rIS - aI, \\
\frac{d R}{ dt} &= aI.
\end{aligned}
$$

What are the variables?
What are the parameters?

Identify an expression for the reproduction number, $R_0$.

Hence explain why the condition $R_0<1$ is necessary to avoid an epidemic?

##  An activator inhibitor model

Consider the reqction schematic
$$
2A+B \rightarrow A.
$$

Assume that species A is produced at constant rate $k_1$ and degrades at rate $k_2$. 

Assume that A is linearly degraded.

Hence obtain the ODEs
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d A}{ dt} &= k_1 - k_2 A + k_3 A^2 B,  \\
\frac{d B}{ dt} &= k_4 - k_3 A^2 B,
\end{aligned}
$$

Identify the steady state of the ODEs.
