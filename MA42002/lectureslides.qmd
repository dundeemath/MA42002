* Introduction to MA42002
* Conservation equations
* Examples of spatially homogeneous models



## Conservation equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
\text{rate of change}\\
\text{ in the population density} 
\end{pmatrix}
&= \begin{pmatrix}
\text{spatial movement}
\end{pmatrix}
\\
 &+\begin{pmatrix}
 \text{birth, growth, death},\\
 \text{production or degradation}\\
  \text{due to chemical reactions} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

#  Spatially homogeneous models (MA32009 revision)

## Example problem - bacteria in a dish
$$\begin{aligned}
N(t+\Delta t) &=  \quad N(t)   + \quad  K N(t) \Delta t.
\end{aligned} 
$$

## A model for cell growth under nutrient depletion

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dN}{dt} &= K(c) N = \kappa cN,  \\
 \frac{ dc}{dt} &= - \alpha \frac{dN}{dt} = - \alpha   \kappa c N,  
 \end{aligned}
$${#eq-c_1}

\vspace{5cm}




## Leading to the logistic growth equation
The last equation can be rewritten as
$$  
\frac{dN}{dt} = \rho  N \,  (1 - \frac N B)  \qquad \quad N(0)= N_0, 
$$ {#eq-n_5}

## Can also consider other biological processes




## Exercise

Consider a well mixed bio reactor. 

A biologist cultures an initial cell population of size $N_0$ in the bioreactor for 72 h.

Cells undergo division with a period of 14 h.

Each cell produces a non-degradable waste product, $W$, at rate $k_1$.

When total waste levels exceed a threshold, $W^*$, cell division stops. Otherwise the cell population grows exponentially.

How many cells are there at the end of the experiment?

##  The SIR model (used in Chapter 7)

Consider the SIR model equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d S}{ dt} &= -rIS, \\
\frac{d I}{ dt} &= rIS - aI, \\
\frac{d R}{ dt} &= aI.
\end{aligned}
$$

What are the variables?
What are the parameters?

Identify an expression for the reproduction number, $R_0$.

Hence explain why the condition $R_0<1$ is necessary to avoid an epidemic?

## SIR model Calculations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d S}{ dt} &= -rIS, \\
\frac{d I}{ dt} &= rIS - aI, \\
\frac{d R}{ dt} &= aI.
\end{aligned}
$$

##  An activator inhibitor model (used in Chapter 6)


Assume that species A is produced at constant rate $k_1$ and degrades at rate $k_2$. 

Assume that B is produced at a constant rate, $k_4$.

Consider the reaction schematic
$$
2A+B \rightarrow 3A,
$$
with reaction rate $k_3$.

Write down governing ODEs.

\vspace{3cm}


## Activator-inhibitor model 

Consider the ODEs
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d a}{ dt} &= k_1 - k_2 a + k_3 a^2 b,  \\
\frac{d b}{ dt} &= k_4 - k_3 a^2 b,
\end{aligned}
$$

Identify the steady state of the ODEs.
How would you compute linear stability of the steady state?

## Lecture 3 Spatiotemporal models

* Derive conservation PDEs
* Consider different models of fluxes
* Boundary conditions

## Spatiotemporal models - derivation
Consider a spatial domain $V$. A conservation equation can be written either in terms of the mass or number of particles of a species as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
\text{rate of change of}\\
\text{number of particles} \\
\text{per unit time } 
\end{pmatrix}
&= \begin{pmatrix}
\text{rate of entry of}\\
\text{particles into $V$}\\
\text{per unit time}
\end{pmatrix}
- \begin{pmatrix}
\text{rate of exit of }\\
\text{particles from $V$}\\
\text{per unit time}
\end{pmatrix} \\
& + 
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \text{rate of degradation}\\
 \text{or creation of particles }\\
  \text{in $V$ per unit time} 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Deriving a conservation equation in 1D
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_x^{x+\Delta x} c(\tilde x, t) A d\tilde x &= J(x,t) \, A  - J(x+\Delta x,t) \, A \\
 &+\int_x^{x + \Delta x}  f(\tilde x, t, c(\tilde x, t))\,  A \, d \tilde x.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-concerv_01}

\vspace{7cm}


## A conservation PDE in 1D

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} c(x,t)  = - \frac  {\partial} { \partial x} J(x,t) + f(x,t ,c(x,t)).
$$ {#eq-concerv_3}

\vspace{5 cm}

## Generalising to $R^n$
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_V c(x,t) \, dx = - \int_{S} J(x,t) \cdot {\mathbf{n}} \, d\sigma + \int_V f(x,t ,c)dx.
$$

##  Fluxes - Fickian diffusion
  $$
    {\mathbf{J}} = - D\nabla c,
  $$ {#eq-diffusion}

  \vspace{7cm}

##  Fluxes - Nonlinear diffusion
$$
  D = D(c) , \qquad \text{ e.g. }\,   D(c)= D_0 c^m, \quad D_0 >0, 
$$

Hence
$$
J=-D(c)\nabla c
$$ 

\vspace{7cm}

## Fluxes - Convection/advection
$$
  {\mathbf{J}} = \mathbf{v}c,
$$ {#eq-diffusion}

\vspace{7cm}

##  Fluxes - Taxis
$$
    {\mathbf{J}} = \chi(a) c \nabla a,  
$$
